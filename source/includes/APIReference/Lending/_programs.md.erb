# Lending Programs

These endpoints return lists of the lending programs offered to our partners. Use it to retrieve
the basic loan structure of each program, including the target customer type, collateral currencies & various fees. With this information you can introduce high-level discovery content within your product to entice customers to learn more.

Before offering any loan programs to your customers you will need to call our [Get Eligibilities for an account](#get-eligibilities-for-an-account) endpoint to determine eligility, as well as the specific conditions of the loan as they apply to the specific customer. Since not all customers will qualify, you should use this endpoint in generic fashion, for example to drive content for a banner on your website homepage, e.g.: <em>"NEW! We've further partnered with our provider to provide a brand new loan program, backed by Bitcoin. You may qualify - contact us today to learn more."</em>
