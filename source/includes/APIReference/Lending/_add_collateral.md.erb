## Add Collateral

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Lending/Examples/add_collateral.tmpl.erb" %>

This endpoint is for adding collateral to further secure the customer’s balance. The customer must have sufficient funds in their wallet, as this operation results in the transfer of cryptocurrency from the customer wallet into the secure vault wallet.

<aside class="success">Encourage your customers to add collateral, for the following reasons: 1) We've found that the more the customer interacts with the product, the more likely they'll keep coming back. 2) Adding collateral results in a lower BTC balance in the user's wallet, causing the customer to want to replenish. 3) It provides added security against BTC price volatility, reduces the LTV and likelihood of liquidation.</aside>
