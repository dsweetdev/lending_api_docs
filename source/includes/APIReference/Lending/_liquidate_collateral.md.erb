## Liquidate Collateral

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Lending/Examples/liquidate_collateral.tmpl.erb" %>

This endpoint is to be used for liquidation of the customer's collateral.

<aside class="info">As lienholder, you are legally authorized to sell off the customer’s collateral under certain conditions (e.g. non-payment or excessive LTV). See legal terms and conditions. Specific to the reason, you must first make multiple attempts to notify the customer and resolve the issue, documenting each occurrence. In the event of non-payment, for example, our recommendation is that you first notify the customer via email and SMS at least 3 times over the course of 72 hours, before proceeding with liquidation. The liquidation amount should be no more than is required for the partner to recover the lost payment, plus fees.</aside>

<aside class="warning">A fee of 5% of the liquidated amount will automatically be deducted for all liquidation transactions</aside>
