## Create a Loan Quote

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Lending/Examples/create_loan_quote.tmpl.erb" %>

Returns a quote for a loan, given the amount requested, and the market price of the cryptocurrency. This operation will use the
properties of the referenced eligibility determination to verify the requested loan amount is within limits, and to calculate the
required collateral amount.

For example:
Requested loan amount is <code>$800</code>, offered by the partner at <code>8.5%</code> interest:

Eligibility Property | Value | Within Limits?
-------- | --------- | ---------
Min Offer USD | 100 | Yes
Max Offer USD | 1000 | Yes
Max APR | 15% | Yes
MaxInitialLTV | 40% | -

Required collateral: <code>(Loan Amount / MaxInitialLTV) / BTC Market Price</code>
<code>(800 / 0.4) / 46195 = 0.04329473 BTC</code>

<aside class="warning">To account for the volatility of Bitcoin prices, the quote is valid only for a brief time (60 seconds). Once expired the quote can no longer be used to create a loan (via the Create a Loan endpoint).</aside>
