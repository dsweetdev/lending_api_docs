# Customer Eligibilities

We will provide a determination on the eligibility for each of your customers, as well as the conditions of the loan that must be met, including lending limits, and the maximum APR you can charge. Consider the following example:

Here are three customer accounts and the eligibility determinations and conditions for each. <em>For
demonstration only - actual business rules will vary.</em> For this example, state of residence determines overall eligibility, whereas BTC balance (and other unlisted factors) determines whether each will qualify for a business loan (offered at more attractive
interest rates, higher amounts, and longer terms).
